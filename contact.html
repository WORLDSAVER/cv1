    <!--action attribute tells what to do mailto:address opens up the mail client and method="post" posts
  all the data in the form to it and the recievers address is the address we mentioned, ennctype stands
for encoding type and it basically tells that all the data we will send will be plain text and due to
this attribute the data will be readable and will not have % . etc, input tag has same tag name but just
changing one of its attributes changes whole input, the name is shown on the email, value is shown on the
input ex value = "submit" for submit button will mean that submit will be written, textarea tag is used
for writing paras, we can give name, we give rows and cols, these are the values that are initially set
for the textarea and these can be modified by toggling the switch-->

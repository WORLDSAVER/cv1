      <p><em>2nd Year B.Tech student at <strong><a href = "https://jcboseust.ac.in/">J.C. Bose University of Science and Technology, Faridabad</a></strong>.</em></p>
      <p>I'm currently studying Electronics and Computer Engineering, my main interests lie in <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/users/warrenbuffet">Data Stuctures, Algorithms</a>,
        and <a href = "https://worldsaver.github.io/UCC/">Web Development</a>.</p></td>

  <!-- in src we can put a link as well as path of an image on our computer, if say we take an image from twitter
  and if for some reason the twitter server goes down then no img will be displayed on our website, to prevent this
it is better to host local images, what happens is that image is downloaded from the twitter server if the
server gives permission to download the image and then the image is displayed, alt tag contains info that must
be shown if the image is not available for some reason, alt tags also help in seo, as google looks for them,
say you have a burrito image then if you put burrito-finish-img in alt then if someone searches for
burriotos then your wesbite is likely to show up, photobucket.com can be used to host your images, and get their links -->
